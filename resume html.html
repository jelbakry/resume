    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
        I am a 19-year-old sophomore majoring in computer science at the Arab Academy for Science and Technology and currently a member of the Egyptian National Fencing Team. My dedication to both academics and fencing reflects my ambition and strong work ethic. As a student-athlete, I am committed to excelling academically while continuing to sharpen my skills on the fencing strip.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being part of the national fencing team has instilled in me the values of discipline, teamwork, and resilience, which I believe are transferrable to various aspects of life.
